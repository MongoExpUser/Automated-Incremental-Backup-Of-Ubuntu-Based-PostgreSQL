### Purpose: PostgreSQL Incremental Backup

- See the realease note here: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release-17.html
##

### Repository Summary
This repository contains the bash scripts and configuration file that can be used to set up automated incremental backup of Ubuntu-Based PostgreSQL as follows:
- Install and configure PostgreSQL 17 server for incremental backup.
- Set up incremental backup on Ubuntu OS at set interval.
- Set up upload of backup to object storage at set interval.

- AWS-CLI 2.18.5
- AWS S3 bucket as object storage
- PostgreSQL 17
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system
##


### Steps to Deploy
The Steps involved in using the bash scripts and the configuration file are as follows:
- Step-1: Install PostgreSQL and modify configuration files
	- Use the script named  <strong> install-config-psql.sh </strong> in the repository for this step, with the following command:
   	  sudo bash install-psql.sh 

- Step-2: Set the atomated backups
	- Use the script named <strong> auto-incremental-backup.sh </strong> in the repository for this step, with following commands, on a screen that runs in the background:
	  - if [[ -f tasks.log ]]; then  echo 'Deleting message log file...'; sudo rm tasks.log; fi                                              
	  - sudo echo '#.. ' > tasks.log && sudo chmod 777 tasks.log                                                                             
	  - sudo chmod u+x incrementa-backup.sh && sudo bash incrementa-backup.sh >> tasks.log 2>&1  
    
- Note: The script takes the initial full backup, and takes incremental backup, merging backups and uploading merged backups to object storage at set interval
